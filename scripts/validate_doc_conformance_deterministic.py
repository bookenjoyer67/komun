"""Validate prose against docs/DOC-STYLE.md rules R1-R4, and resolve every citation.

Lesson 4.3, "Implement the Deterministic Replacement", block [65] (VERBATIM, the contract the
replacement must hold): "Same input", "Same output format", "No language model" ("no calls to the
OpenRouter API, no agent invocations, and no inference of any kind"), "Readable on its own".

The step this replaces is the prose-and-citation conformance check the `komun-docs-stylist` agent and
the `reviewer` agent ran by hand: apply R1-R4 to a prose file, then re-execute every `path:line`
citation behind a claim. Recorded evidence for the step, and for each rule's detection, follows.

Rule set and detection -- docs/DOC-STYLE.md v2, the "Rules (v2)" table (VERBATIM rows, and the
"How a violation is detected" cell of each):

    | R1 | A section opens with the question it answers. An existing "This section ..." purpose
    |      sentence is deleted. | the first line after the heading is not a question, or opens with
    |      "This section" |
    | R2 | Every claim carries its authority in parentheses, naming the artifact **and** the literal
    |      text, value or count that settles it. | a parenthetical that names a file, command or
    |      search but quotes nothing from it |
    | R3 | A sentence is at most 35 words. | word count of the text between two sentence terminators |
    | R4 | A rule is an imperative, and never hedges (`should`, `might`, `probably`, `may want to`).
    |      | a bullet whose first word is not a verb |

Authority forms -- docs/DOC-STYLE.md v2, section "Authority forms (v2)" (VERBATIM): "a bare location
is a v1 form and fails R2 in v2: `(crates/server/src/api/mod.rs:44)` names an artifact but quotes
nothing from it."

The untraceable-claim path -- docs/DOC-STYLE.md, section "A claim you cannot trace" (VERBATIM): "Do
not delete the claim, and do not invent authority for it. Mark the sentence with `[UNVERIFIED]`". A
line carrying that marker is therefore exempt from the R2 check, and the exemption is tested.

Citations -- the second half of the same step. The repository's recorded failure classes are a
citation to the wrong file and a citation that lands one line off: `docs/iteration-log.md:568-574`
(the pointer resolves to another file) and `docs/iteration-log.md:515-521` ("the quoted text is
correct and the reader lands one line away"). This script resolves each `path:start[-end]` plus its
quoted literal against the repository and reports `CIT-FILE-MISSING`, `CIT-LITERAL-MISSING` or
`CIT-LINE-DRIFT` with the line the literal really sits on.

Interface, and why -- the lesson requires that "The deterministic script reads input from a named
file argument and writes output to a named file argument":

    python3 scripts/validate_doc_conformance_deterministic.py \
        --input docs/DOC-STYLE.md --input AGENTS.md --output /tmp/conformance.json

`--input` names one prose file and repeats; `--output` names the JSON report. Exit status 0 means no
violation, 1 means at least one violation, 2 means the invocation itself was wrong. The report holds
no timestamp, so two runs over one input are byte-identical.

What this script does not decide (printed under "limitations" in every report)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* R4's "first word is not a verb" clause needs a verb lexicon the standard does not define. This
  script checks the four hedge words the standard names and reports the verb-initial clause as not
  implemented, rather than guessing a word list.
* A command authority such as (`` `cargo test --workspace` -> `158 passed, 0 failed` ``) needs the
  command to be executed. This script counts those citations and leaves them unverified.
* A parenthetical holding *no* authority token is not checked, because R2's detection names only the
  parenthetical that "names a file, command or search but quotes nothing from it".
