"""The ``conformance`` gate: run the deterministic prose-and-citation check, fail on NEW drift only.

Why this file exists
--------------------
``scripts/validate_doc_conformance_deterministic.py`` implements the converted step, but inside the
workflow nothing could run it: the gate server is the only execution path any role holds, and it
exposed three name-only Rust gates. The ``conformance`` gate closes that gap. It is invoked by name,
with no arguments, from the gate vocabulary in ``agentic.config.json``:

    "conformance": {
      "argv": ["python3", "scripts/run-conformance-gate.py"],
      ...
    }

The wrapper takes no argument of its own. Any argument is refused with exit 2 and one line on
stderr, so there is no flag, no path and no mode a caller can contribute. The prose file set comes
from the config key ``gates.conformance.files`` (``agentic.config.json``), not from a caller and not
from a literal inside this file; the embedded default below is this repository's copy of that list,
so a run with no config file behaves exactly as a run with it.

The verdict: new drift only
---------------------------
The repository's ten configured files carry 135 pre-existing findings at HEAD, so a gate that failed
on any finding would be red on every run and would be switched off. This gate compares, per file, the
working-tree findings against the same file at ``HEAD`` -- exactly the comparison the CI fmt gate
makes between base and current -- and fails only when a rule's finding count INCREASES:

* exit 0 when every rule's count is equal to, or lower than, its count at HEAD;
* exit 1 when any rule (R1, R2, R3, R4 or CIT) finds more than it found at HEAD;
* exit 2 when the invocation itself is wrong: an argument, a missing checker, a config file naming a
  file the tree does not have, or a tree that is not a git checkout.

What is compared, and what is not
---------------------------------
* R1-R4 and the citation findings are compared as per-file counts against ``HEAD``. A count that
  falls is a repair and passes; a count that rises is new drift and fails. Pre-existing findings
  never fail the gate.
* The ``HEAD`` copy of a file is materialised into a scratch directory with ``git show HEAD:<path>``.
  The checker resolves citations against the repository root it is handed, and BOTH passes are handed
  the same root. The honest consequence, printed as ``citation_comparison`` in every report: a
  citation that points into another file resolves identically in both passes, and only the file's own
  citation LIST can differ; a citation a file makes into ITSELF therefore resolves against the
  working-tree copy in the base pass too. So a citation added or removed by the change under test is
  visible as new drift, and a line shifted inside the file under test is not. The document rule set
  R1-R4 is compared on the file's own text in both passes.
* A file ``HEAD`` does not carry has no baseline. It is reported with ``base_comparable: false`` and
  its findings are not counted as new, because there is nothing for them to have drifted from; the
  reason is printed next to the file.
* Only the per-rule counts and the new findings are reported; the full checker report is discarded.
  The summary holds no timestamp, so two runs over one tree print the same object.
