//! The views the three screens draw, assembled from real readings.

//! `Snapshot::collect` is the only place that runs a command or reads a file. Everything the UI

//! came from and the age of the reading, so a cached value can never masquerade as a live one.
//!
//! `Snapshot::collect_cached` is the path the worker thread uses: the same reads, through a
//! [`ProbeCache`] that remembers each probe's last answer with its own time-to-live. A cached answer
//! carries the instant it was read -- never the instant it was served -- and is stored exactly as it
//! was read, failures included.
