//! `--probe-timings`: what each probe costs, measured rather than asserted.
//!
//! Every probe runs; the report prints each one's name, the exact invocation behind its answer, how
//! long that took, its time-to-live and whether the cache answered it -- then the total for the pass.
//! The second pass is the console's steady state: the same collect immediately after, on the cadence
//! the config gives each probe, where the expensive one is answered from memory and only the cheap
//! local reads run again.
//!
//! This is how the before/after is proven: the cold pass is what the console used to do on every
//! refresh, and the warm pass is what it does now.
