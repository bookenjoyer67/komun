//! The actions, and the command construction behind each one.
//!
//! Three rules this module exists to hold:
//!
//! * **Every action shows its exact argv before it runs**, and requires a confirmation keypress. The
//!   argv is executed directly, element by element, never through a shell, so what is displayed is
//!   what runs.
//! * **Safety is by construction.** No action removes anything, restarts a container, kills a
//!   process, writes inside the repository or runs a git command. The full set is the seven below;
//!   there is no "run an arbitrary command" action to fall back on.
//! * **A guard refuses before the command is built**, and the reason is a string the UI shows.
