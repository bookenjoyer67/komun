//! agentic-console: a terminal window onto a repository's agentic quality-gate artifacts.
//!
//! The crate is a library plus a thin binary so the screens can be rendered and asserted on in tests
//! with ratatui's `TestBackend`. Four properties hold across every module:
//!
//! * nothing is invented: every value on every screen is a file read, a `docker` call, or a command's
//!   output, and `state::Snapshot` is the only place that reads anything;
//! * every reading carries its source and its age, so a cached value is visibly cached;
//! * the console is read-only toward the repository, and every action shows its exact command and
//!   waits for a confirmation keypress before it runs;
//! * no read happens on the UI thread. `collector::Collector` owns a worker thread that takes every
//!   snapshot and hands it to the UI over a channel, so a keypress is answered immediately even while
//!   the gate server is being asked for its gate list.
