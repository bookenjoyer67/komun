//! The checkpoint card: the one UI element that turns a state reading into a human decision.
//!
//! The orchestration runs headless: `claude -p "<brief>" --agent orchestrator --permission-mode
//! acceptEdits`. At a human checkpoint the orchestrator ends its turn and the CLI process exits, and
//! the next phase is a separate invocation that resumes **one named session**: `claude --resume
//! <session-id> -p "<ruling>" --permission-mode acceptEdits`. Two invocations of the same session,
//! then: a process being in flight means the run is *working*, never waiting, and the waiting
//! happens after the process is gone. So the actionable state is a checkpoint the evidence names
//! while nothing is running -- the run stopped there and the ruling is what resumes it -- and a
//! checkpoint named while a process is alive only means the checkpoint lies ahead of that process.
//!
//! The console never decides that a checkpoint is open. It looks for evidence, in this order, and
//! says which piece of evidence it used:
//!
//! 1. the prompt of a run that is in flight in the container right now (the `-p` argument of the
//!    agent process): what that run was told to do, including any checkpoint it is told to stop at;
//! 2. the tail of the **session's own transcript** in the container
//!    (`<console.session_dir>/<session-id>.jsonl`), read through the probe layer for the session the
//!    card names: the run's own words, and the one read that settles the checkpoint on its own;
//! 3. an evidence-directory transcript, but only one that is **attributable to that session** -- its
//!    own file name carries the session id, or its own metadata block names it. A transcript there
//!    that carries no session id is somebody else's copy until it says otherwise, so it is ignored
//!    and the card says so;
//! 4. the storage journal's supporting shape: a plan entry with no implementation entry after it.
//!
//! The journal is corroboration, not a tie-breaker: when its shape and the session's own transcript
//! name different checkpoints the card reports the disagreement and offers no ruling, the same way
//! it treats two reads that name two different sessions. Nothing here invents a checkpoint, and
//! nothing here lets one run's evidence name another run's checkpoint.
//!
//! A ruling also has to say *which* conversation it is resuming, and `--continue` -- resume the
//! newest session -- cannot: with two runs in one container it sends the ruling into whichever
//! session wrote last, whoever started it. So the card names one session too, from its own read of
//! the container's session directory (the CLI writes one `<session-id>.jsonl` per session, so the
//! file's name is the id), and the ruling is built with `--resume <that-id>` or refused. A refusal
//! is the right answer when the evidence cannot name exactly one session: resuming the wrong
//! conversation is worse than not resuming at all.
