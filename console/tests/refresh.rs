//! The refresh architecture: the worker, the cadence table, and the loop that never waits.
//!
//! Every test here fails against the console that called `Snapshot::collect` from its event loop:
//! there was no worker, no cache, no cadence and no `ui::step`. They are the new contract, stated:
//!
//! * a probe called twice inside its TTL executes once;
//! * a cached answer carries the instant it was read, not the instant it was served;
//! * the UI keeps drawing and handling keys while a collect is in flight;
//! * a failed read is not quietly replaced by an older success;
//! * `r` forces a collect that no TTL may serve from the cache.
//!
//! Nothing here touches a running container or a live run: the configs point at a container name
//! that does not exist, so every `docker exec` fails at once and the tests measure the cache and the
//! loop, not the gate server.
