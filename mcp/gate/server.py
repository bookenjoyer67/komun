"""Quality-gate MCP server for the Komun repository.

Exposes a fixed, allowlisted execution surface over streamable HTTP (FastMCP): six named
commands. Five are check-mode -- ``test``, ``clippy``, ``fmt``, ``policy`` and ``conformance`` --
and ``run_gate`` runs those; one is write-mode, ``fmt-fix``, and ``run_fix`` alone runs it. A
caller names a command, never a command line: every argv comes from an ``agentic.config.json``
entry, ``shell`` is never used, and no caller-supplied string reaches a command line.

Each invocation returns the exit code, the captured stdout and stderr, the wall-clock duration and a
verdict, and appends one journal line naming the ``tool`` that ran it and its ``writes`` mode. A
refused call runs nothing and journals nothing, so the journal holds only executed commands.

The ``clippy`` gate carries the project's cache-hit guard, whose marker line and touched file are
read from ``toolchain.commands.clippy.guard``. cargo's second run over an unchanged tree prints
nothing and exits 0, which is indistinguishable from a clean lint, so the gate touches a file
under test before invoking cargo and then requires the configured marker line in the output.
``passed`` for clippy is therefore exit code 0 *and* a satisfied guard. This image runs cargo with
``CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always``, so status lines arrive wrapped in SGR escapes and the guard matches the
output with the escapes stripped; the returned stdout and stderr are stripped for the same reason.

Run inside the sandbox container:

# removed; a naive substring search over the raw bytes finds nothing and would report every clippy
# run as a cache hit. The pattern is `gate_vocabulary.py`'s, from the config's marker_regex.

    The write-mode counterpart of ``run_gate`` and its exact mirror: the name is resolved against
    the write-mode table alone, so a check-mode gate is refused however it is spelled, and the argv
    comes from that table and nowhere else. No parameter carries an argv element, a path, a flag, a
    cwd or a shell, so this tool widens what the server can run by exactly one configured command
    and by nothing else. The journal records it as a mutation.
