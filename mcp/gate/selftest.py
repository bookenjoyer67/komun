"""Self-test for the quality-gate MCP server.

Calls the running server over streamable HTTP and asserts the behaviours the server claims: the tool
surface, the eight-command allowlist and the mode published for each, refusal of a free-form command,
a passthrough and a shell-injection string on three of the seven check-mode names, refusal in both
directions across the mode boundary, the clippy cache-hit guard (the test guard is not asserted here), real exit codes from the three Rust
gates, and one audit-journal line per executed invocation. Every check prints PASS or FAIL with its
evidence; any FAIL makes the process exit non-zero, and the output is the record of a real run.

The write-mode command is never executed here. It rewrites the tree, and a self-test that formatted
the workspace would change the thing the ``fmt`` gate is measuring, so ``fmt-fix`` is exercised only
through the refusals that prove it is unreachable from the check surface.

Run against a server already listening inside the sandbox container:

    python3 mcp/gate/server.py --port 8003 &
    python3 mcp/gate/selftest.py --url http://localhost:8003/mcp
