"""The command vocabulary this repository's gate server exposes, read from ``agentic.config.json``.

``mcp/gate/server.py`` is the execution surface; everything a fork must change about it -- the
command names, the argv tuple of each, the mode each runs in, each command's cache-hit guard, the
container paths the commands run in -- is read here, from the config's ``toolchain.commands`` and
``containers`` blocks, instead of being written into the server. The command names under
``toolchain.commands`` ARE the vocabulary: a fork adds a command by adding one entry there and
changing no Python. Nothing in the vocabulary is caller-supplied: it is composed once, at import
time, from the config alone.

Each command declares its mode with ``writes``. The vocabulary is split on that boolean into two
disjoint tables: ``GATES``, the check-mode commands ``run_gate`` may run, and ``FIX_COMMANDS``, the
write-mode commands ``run_fix`` may run. Neither tool can reach the other's table, so a write-mode
command can never be run by the check surface and a check-mode command can never be run by the fix
surface. ``COMMANDS`` holds both and is what ``list_gates`` publishes.

Each command may also declare an output-summary rule under ``summary``, read and normalised here
exactly as the guard is. The rule names what to count in the command's own output, so a gate whose
numbers exist only inside a six-figure payload can report them; its patterns are compiled at import
time, and a command that declares no rule carries ``summary`` None, which is most of them.

The loader is stdlib only and falls back to its own embedded defaults, which are this repository's
values, so the server behaves exactly as it did before the config existed when the config file is
absent, unreadable or not valid JSON.

``print_config_if_requested()`` answers the server's ``--print-config`` flag: a JSON object of
exactly the config keys this vocabulary consumes, sorted, with no command run and no journal read.
