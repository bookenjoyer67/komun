# Agent context boundary policy

Policy version: v0.1.0 (2026-09-26). This file is read automatically at the start of every session in
this directory. `AGENTS.md` is the project's cold-start guide; this file is the standing policy for how
context is managed across a session, and it applies to every agent working here.

## Context Boundary Procedure

At the start of each new phase of work, before any editing or analysis:

1. Restate the current task goal in one sentence.
2. List the rules currently in effect, verbatim, not paraphrased.
3. State explicitly which prior rules are no longer in effect, if any.
4. Name the specific artifact this phase works on.
5. Then proceed with the requested work.

A phase begins whenever the rules change, the target file changes, or the session moves from producing
work to revising work already produced. The user supplies the boundary text; if a phase starts without
one, ask for it before editing.

## Summarization Policy

- The summarization skill lives at `.claude/skills/summarize-session`. Invoke it when a phase ends and
  new rules are about to be introduced, at any other natural breakpoint, or when the user asks.
- The summary must copy rules and artifact text verbatim. A paraphrase of an acceptance criterion or of
  a document's current text is a defect, because the summary replaces the history it describes.
- Present the summary and wait for the user to confirm or correct it before doing any further work.

## Compaction Policy

Proactive summarization above is the first line of defence; compaction is the fallback. This repository
has not yet observed a `/compact` run, so what compaction reliably preserves here is deliberately
unrecorded rather than guessed. Session plan for the current run: boundaries and one summary, with
`/compact` used only if context usage actually crosses ~60% — and if that happens, the pre/post usage
figures and the recall probes go into the iteration log.

## Memory Configuration

At the start of every session, read .memory/project/MEMORY_INDEX.md
to orient yourself. Then read any active entries listed there that
are relevant to the current task.

Before making any significant decision or observing something worth
remembering across sessions, check the index for an existing entry
on the same topic. Update existing entries rather than creating
duplicates.

### Memory layers

- .memory/project/ — Read on startup via MEMORY_INDEX.md. You may
  write new entries here when a significant decision is made or
  project state changes.

- .memory/knowledge/ — Read-only. Consult before making any decision
  that touches coding standards or architectural constraints. Never
  attempt to write to this directory.

- .memory/reference/ — Read-only. Query by keyword for relevant
  excerpts when you need background context. Do not read the entire
  directory.

### Write policy

Before writing any content to a memory file, classify it:
- If it is Public or Internal: proceed with writing
- If it is Confidential: do not write it to memory. Note in your response that the information was not stored and explain where it should be retrieved from instead.
- If it is Secret (credential, token, API key, PII): do not write it anywhere. Use it for the immediate task only. If you find a secret already written in a memory file, flag it immediately and do not proceed until a human removes it.

Before writing a new memory entry, check MEMORY_INDEX.md for an
existing entry on the same topic. Update existing entries rather
than creating new ones. Never write anything classified as
Confidential or Secret to any memory layer.

### Stale memory policy

If a memory entry's review date has passed, flag it in your session
output and ask for human confirmation before acting on it.

### Scope verification

Read SCOPE.md at the root of .memory/ on startup. If it does not
match this project, halt and report the mismatch before doing
anything else.

## Orchestration

The pre-merge gate on this repository runs as an orchestrated workflow. The orchestrator sequences the
work and evaluates what comes back; it never writes production code and never runs a gate command.

### Goal and acceptance criteria

- Goal: take one requested change to Komun from request to a reviewed, mergeable diff.
- Acceptance criteria for every run: `cargo test --workspace` passes, `cargo clippy --release -- -D warnings`
  reports zero warnings, `cargo fmt --check` is clean, `npm run check` and `npx vitest run` pass under `web/`,
  and every changed prose file satisfies `docs/DOC-STYLE.md`, and every changed file under `web/` satisfies
  `docs/UI-STYLE.md` (read `.claude/skills/frontend-craft/SKILL.md` first).

### Ordered sequence

1. `project-manager` opens the ticket and records the acceptance criteria above.
2. `planner` decomposes the change into ordered steps, writes the plan to the `storage` MCP server under
   project `proj-komun`, and returns that entry id.
3. Human checkpoint 1 — plan approval. The run stops here until a human approves or amends the plan.
4. `implementer` writes the change, records its decisions in storage, and returns the entry ids.
5. `tester` runs the gate commands and records the raw output as a storage entry.
6. `reviewer` reads the `conformance` gate's report for the changed prose files (`agentic.config.json:79` `"argv": ["python3", "scripts/run-conformance-gate.py"],`). The tester runs that gate by name, so the verdict rests on the report rather than on prose.
7. Human checkpoint 2 — release approval. The run stops here until a human approves the merge.
8. `project-manager` closes the ticket with the delivered scope.

### Evaluation gate

Evaluate every subagent output before the next role starts. Check three things: the handoff format
defined by `.memory/knowledge/handoff-subagent-to-orchestrator.md`, the entry id the role claims to have
written, and the acceptance criterion it claims to satisfy. An output that fails the format returns to
the same role once, with the specific defect named.

### Branching logic

- Loop: return a failed or malformed output to the same role once. A second failure escalates.
- Skip: skip `reviewer` when the change touches no prose file and no code path named in the plan's scope.
- Halt: stop the run when a role reports a blocked precondition, and name the missing input in the summary.
- Escalate: hand back to the human when a role fails twice, when a fix would change the plan's scope, or
  when the change touches `migrations/` or authentication code.

### Human checkpoints

Two, and both are required: plan approval before any implementation work, and release approval before
anything reaches `main`. The orchestrator stops and waits at each, and records the approval in the run
summary.

### Roles and tool grants

`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md` is the decision of record for who may call what. When an agent
definition and that map disagree, change the definition to match the map. The seven roles are
`orchestrator`, `planner`, `implementer`, `tester`, `reviewer`, `project-manager` and the optional
`researcher`.
