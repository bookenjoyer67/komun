# Agent Governance Policy

Version: v1.0.0
Last updated: 2026-09-28
Reviewed by: pending — no human has signed this v1.0.0 draft, and the Module 4.1 checkpoint owns the approval.

## Policy basis

What does this policy derive from, and where does each authority sit?

- Derive every grant from the routing-and-tool-grant map (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:7` `This map is the design decision of record for the gate.`).
- Read the machine-readable grant list as the same map's operative form (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:11` `"grants"`).
- Derive every denial from the near-miss patterns observed in calibration (`docs/calibration-log.md` section `Near-miss patterns for Module 4 governance`, patterns `NM-1` to `NM-9`).
- Apply least-privilege defaults to all eight roles (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:77` `Grant mcp__storage__delete_entry to no role`).
- Use this repo's paths rather than the lesson's (`sandbox/README-m3.md:54` `the memory directory stays inside the repo at /workspace/.memory`).
- Treat `/memory` as absent in this container (`docker exec agent-rev-m3 ls -d /memory` -> `No such file or directory`).
- Bound every ceiling by the memory classification levels (`docs/memory-architecture.md:149` `Do not store in agent memory.`).

## Least-privilege default

How does a role acquire access, and what does it hold before any grant?

Start every role at no access: no MCP operation, no skill, no retrieval ceiling, no autonomy.
Record every grant beside the artifact that states it, and give every denial a one-line reason.
Adopt the narrower authority where a role definition and the map disagree (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:7` `Update an agent definition to match this map whenever the two disagree.`).

## Role 1 — `orchestrator`

What does the sequencing role hold, and what does it decide?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the orchestrator call?

- Hold no MCP operation at all, and keep the harness tools `Task`, `Read`, `Write` and `Edit` (`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md:10` `tools: Task, Read, Write, Edit`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_read` and `mcp__coursetools__file_write` (`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md:11` `disallowedTools: Bash, mcp__coursetools__file_read`).
- Deny every storage operation (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:43` `Deny the Orchestrator every storage operation`) — this denial answers `NM-3`, where the orchestrator called a denied storage operation mid-run.
- Deny `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:60` `it queries no corpus`).
- Deny `Bash` and `mcp__coursetools__test_runner` (`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md:38` `Denied; gate commands belong to the tester`).
- Deny `mcp__gate__run_gate`, `mcp__gate__list_gates` and `mcp__gate__read_audit_log` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:92` `evaluates its own execution`) — this denial answers `NM-4`, where a role graded a record it wrote.
- Resolve the orchestrator file-tool conflict by fixing the map: `docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:15` now denies `mcp__coursetools__file_read` and `mcp__coursetools__file_write`, and `docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:11` reads `"orchestrator": []`.

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the orchestrator activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` at a phase boundary (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:6` `phase is ending and new rules or new material are about to arrive`).
- Permit `write-child-brief` before spawning any role, so the child starts from measured context (`.claude/skills/write-child-brief/SKILL.md:13` `A role reads its brief, its own definition and the artifacts it may open,`). Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Carry the summary's unresolved questions into the run summary (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:38` `Anything unresolved: claims that could not be verified`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may this role touch?

- Hold no retrieval ceiling and no storage ceiling (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:76` `"orchestrator": "none"`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md:51` `only the roles that produce a result record it in storage`) — this denial answers `NM-5`, where a credential stood inside memory reach.
- Keep the run summary at `internal` or below (`docs/memory-architecture.md:147` `Safe within the team but not for public repos.`).

### Autonomy level

How far does this role act before a human decides?

- Hold `high` autonomy (`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md:12` `autonomy: high`).
- Decide loop, skip, halt and escalate, and own neither checkpoint (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:15` `a human owns both checkpoints`).
- Escalate to the human after a role fails twice (`.claude/agents/orchestrator.md:63` `when a role fails twice`).

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-write at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:165` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace")`), and mounts `/workspace/.memory` read-only (`scripts/run-agent.sh:171` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO/.memory:/workspace/.memory:ro")`). This role reads and writes orchestration documents under `/workspace`, and it holds no memory write grant (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:12` `"orchestrator": []`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Role 2 — `planner`

What does the planning role hold, and what may it not read or write?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the planner call?

- Grant `mcp__coursetools__file_read` and `mcp__coursetools__codebase_search` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:10-11` `- mcp__coursetools__codebase_search`) — this grant answers `NM-2`, where a planner that could not read its inputs planned from the brief alone.
- Grant `mcp__storage__read_entry`, `mcp__storage__list_entries` and `mcp__storage__write_entry` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:12-14` `- mcp__storage__write_entry`).
- Grant `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` at the `internal` ceiling (`.claude/agents/planner.md:15` `- mcp__retrieval__retrieve`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_write` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:75` `writing it is the implementer's role`) — a planning role writes no code.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__shell` and `mcp__coursetools__test_runner` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:76-77` `no command execution while planning`) — no plan step rests on an unrun command.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__task_tracker` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:78` `ticket state belongs to the project manager`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__web_search` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:73` `Hold mcp__coursetools__web_search on the Researcher alone`) — one role keeps open-web text out of every coding context.
- Deny `mcp__storage__update_entry` and `mcp__storage__delete_entry` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:44` `a plan is a new entry rather than a revision or a removal`).

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the planner activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` at the plan-approval boundary (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:7` `when the user asks for a session summary`).
- Permit `frontend-craft` when the plan includes a change under `web/`, so the plan accounts for the states the work needs (`.claude/skills/frontend-craft/SKILL.md:64` `when the change's file list includes`).
- Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Name the unread artifact and halt when a rule cannot be settled from the repository (`.claude/agents/planner.md:62` `Halt and return to the orchestrator when the request cannot be planned`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may the planner read and write?

- Cap retrieval at `internal` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:74` `the pinned internal ceiling`).
- Write the plan entry at `classification: "internal"` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:59` `classification: "internal"`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`.claude/agents/planner.md:73` `classification public or internal only`) — this denial answers `NM-5`.

### Autonomy level

How far does the planner act before a human decides?

- Hold `medium` autonomy (`.claude/agents/planner.md:23` `autonomy: medium`).
- Wait for the human plan-approval checkpoint before any implementer starts (`.claude/agents/planner.md:33` `the plan is a proposal until the human clears the plan-approval checkpoint`).
- Resolve the planner autonomy conflict by fixing the definition: `.claude/agents/planner.md:23` now reads `autonomy: medium`, matching `docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:16` `Medium — it orders the work`.

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-only at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:167` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace:ro")`), and mounts `/workspace/.memory` read-write so the granted entry write lands (`scripts/run-agent.sh:170` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO/.memory:/workspace/.memory")`). This role reads every file in `/workspace`, writes no file there, and writes one plan entry into `/workspace/.memory` (`.claude/agents/planner.md:75` `writing it is the implementer's role`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Role 3 — `implementer`

What does the writing role hold, and what may it never run or delete?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the implementer call?

- Grant `mcp__coursetools__file_read`, `mcp__coursetools__file_write` and `mcp__coursetools__codebase_search` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:11-12` `- mcp__coursetools__file_write`).
- Grant `mcp__storage__read_entry`, `mcp__storage__list_entries`, `mcp__storage__write_entry` and `mcp__storage__update_entry` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:16-16` `- mcp__storage__update_entry`).
- Grant `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` at the `internal` ceiling (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:17` `- mcp__retrieval__retrieve`).
- Grant `mcp__gate__run_fix` on this role alone (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:18` `- mcp__gate__run_fix`) — it runs a write-mode command by name, and the vocabulary holds one such name, `fmt-fix`.
- Scope `mcp__storage__update_entry` to the entries this role wrote (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:76` `the only role that revises a record it wrote`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__shell` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:89` `no build or migration runs from the writing role`) — the writing role executes nothing.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__test_runner` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:90` `a self-run gate is not independent evidence`) — this denial answers `NM-1`, where a gate that never ran held no evidence.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__task_tracker` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:91` `ticket state belongs to the project manager`).
- Deny `mcp__storage__delete_entry` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:92` `records are never removed`) — a superseded decision stays readable.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__web_search` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:73` `Hold mcp__coursetools__web_search on the Researcher alone`) — the writing role holds no network tool.
- Deny `mcp__gate__run_gate` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:24` `- mcp__gate__run_gate`) — the check surface stays the tester's, so the role that writes a fix never runs the gate that judges it.

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the implementer activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` at a repair-cycle boundary (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:6-7` `when the context window is filling`).
- Permit `frontend-craft` when the change touches `web/`, so the writing role applies the interface rules (`.claude/skills/frontend-craft/SKILL.md:61` `those are the roles that write and judge interface code`).
- Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Return an unnamed file to the orchestrator rather than writing it (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:46-47` `A file the change needs that the plan does not name is a scope change`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may the implementer read and write?

- Cap retrieval at `internal` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:87` `the pinned internal ceiling`).
- Write entries at `public` or `internal` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:68` `The storage server accepts public and internal writes only`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:85` `the server rejects confidential and secret`) — this denial answers `NM-5`.
- Deny any credential or message plaintext in a written file (`docs/memory-architecture.md:151` `Must never appear in any memory file.`).

### Autonomy level

How far does the implementer act before a human decides?

- Hold `medium` autonomy (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:25` `autonomy: medium`).
- Act on the approved plan without a further human checkpoint (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:35` `acts on an approved plan without a further human checkpoint`).
- Return each change for independent test instead of clearing it (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:74` `state plainly that the implementer ran none of them`).

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-write at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:165` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace")`), and mounts `/workspace/.memory` read-write for its entry writes (`scripts/run-agent.sh:170` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO/.memory:/workspace/.memory")`). This role writes the files the plan names under `/workspace`, and it writes and revises its own entries in `/workspace/.memory` (`.claude/agents/implementer.md:92` `records are never removed`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Role 4 — `tester`

What does the verifying role hold, and what may it never repair?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the tester call?

- Grant `mcp__coursetools__file_read` (`.claude/agents/tester.md:11` `- mcp__coursetools__file_read`).
- Grant `mcp__gate__run_gate`, `mcp__gate__list_gates` and `mcp__gate__read_audit_log` (`.claude/agents/tester.md:12-14` `- mcp__gate__run_gate`) — this grant answers `NM-1`, where an inert tool blocked every gate.
- Grant `mcp__storage__read_entry`, `mcp__storage__list_entries` and `mcp__storage__write_entry` (`.claude/agents/tester.md:15-17` `- mcp__storage__write_entry`).
- Resolve the tester-runner conflict by fixing the map: `docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:18` now grants `mcp__gate__run_gate` and denies `mcp__coursetools__test_runner`. The stub is `the course's deliberately inert stub` (`docs/iteration-log.md:383-384`), and this grant answers `NM-1`.
- Deny every command string and extra argument through the gate server (`mcp/gate/server.py:125` `it accepts no command string, no extra arguments`) — a refused call runs nothing. The vocabulary holds eight commands: the seven check-mode names `test`, `clippy`, `fmt`, `policy`, `conformance`, `webcheck` and `webtest`, and one write-mode name, `fmt-fix`.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_write` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:18` `a verifying role repairs nothing it finds`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__shell` and `mcp__coursetools__task_tracker` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:18` `a result is a new record`).
- Deny `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:63` `it works from the supplied acceptance criteria`).
- Deny `mcp__storage__update_entry` and `mcp__storage__delete_entry` (`.claude/agents/tester.md:89` `a gate result is a new record`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__web_search` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:73` `Hold mcp__coursetools__web_search on the Researcher alone`) — the tester reads no open-web text.
- Deny `mcp__gate__run_fix` (`.claude/agents/tester.md:25` `- mcp__gate__run_fix`) — the verifying role repairs nothing it finds, so the write-mode command stays with the implementer.

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the tester activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` after a gate run (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:6-7` `when the context window is filling`).
- Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Name the cache-hit prerequisite as a blocker rather than touching a source file (`.claude/agents/tester.md:54` `a silent second run is a cache hit, not a clean lint`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may the tester record?

- Hold no retrieval ceiling (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:79` `"tester": "none"`).
- Write the result entry at `classification: "internal"` (`.claude/agents/tester.md:62` `classification: "internal"`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`.claude/agents/tester.md:61-62` `accepts public and internal writes only`) — this denial answers `NM-5`.
- Print a failure's output in full, with no filtering (`.claude/agents/tester.md:59` `Print each failure's output in full, with no filtering`).

### Autonomy level

How far does the tester act before a human decides?

- Hold `low` autonomy (`.claude/agents/tester.md:26` `autonomy: low`).
- Decide when a gate has passed against the recorded baseline (`.claude/agents/tester.md:37` `decides when a gate has passed against the baseline`).
- Report a gate as INCONCLUSIVE when its prerequisite is unmet (`.claude/agents/tester.md:50-51` `report the gate as inconclusive when the prerequisite is unmet`).
- Resolve the tester autonomy conflict by fixing the definition: `.claude/agents/tester.md:25` now reads `autonomy: low`, matching `docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:18` `Low — it runs the fixed gates and reports`.

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-only at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:167` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace:ro")`), and mounts `/workspace/.memory` read-write so the granted entry write lands (`scripts/run-agent.sh:170` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO/.memory:/workspace/.memory")`). This role reads `/workspace` and runs the gates against it, writes no file there, and writes one test-result entry into `/workspace/.memory` (`.claude/agents/tester.md:64` `Never create, edit, move or delete a repository file`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Role 5 — `reviewer`

What does the reviewing role hold, and what may it never fix?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the reviewer call?

- Grant `mcp__coursetools__file_read` and `mcp__coursetools__codebase_search` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:11-11` `- mcp__coursetools__codebase_search`).
- Grant `mcp__storage__read_entry`, `mcp__storage__list_entries` and `mcp__storage__write_entry` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:14-14` `- mcp__storage__write_entry`).
- Grant `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` at the `internal` ceiling (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:15` `- mcp__retrieval__retrieve`) — the verdict half keeps this read, and the converted conformance step holds no MCP grant (`docs/adr/ADR-001-doc-conformance-deterministic-conversion.md`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_write` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:94` `the reviewer edits nothing it reviews`) — this denial answers `NM-4`, where an approval shared the author of the verdict it approved.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__shell` and `mcp__coursetools__test_runner` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:93-94` `a re-run by the reviewer would overwrite the recorded evidence`) — this denial answers `NM-7`, where an unrun gate was closed unevidenced.
- Resolve the reviewer gate-tool conflict by fixing the definition: `.claude/agents/reviewer.md:16-17` now grants `mcp__gate__list_gates` and `mcp__gate__read_audit_log`, which `docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:38` `"mcp__gate__list_gates"` already granted, and `.claude/agents/reviewer.md:25` keeps `mcp__gate__run_gate` denied.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__task_tracker` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:97` `ticket state belongs to the project manager`).
- Deny `mcp__storage__update_entry` and `mcp__storage__delete_entry` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:98` `a review is a new record`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__web_search` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:73` `Hold mcp__coursetools__web_search on the Researcher alone`) — the review rests on this repository's own standards.

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the reviewer activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` at the review boundary (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:6-7` `when the context window is filling`).
- Permit `frontend-craft` when reviewing a change under `web/`, so the review holds the interface to its own rules (`.claude/skills/frontend-craft/SKILL.md:61` `those are the roles that write and judge interface code`).
- Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Hand no part of the review to another agent (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:40` `hands no part of the review to another agent`).
- Apply the documentation standard from this role rather than delegating it (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:48` `v2 is the current rule set`); its prose and citation half is converted and runs as `scripts/validate_doc_conformance_deterministic.py` (`docs/adr/ADR-001-doc-conformance-deterministic-conversion.md`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may the reviewer read?

- Cap retrieval at `internal` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:90` `the pinned internal ceiling`).
- Write the review entry at `classification: "internal"` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:74` `classification: "internal"`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:96` `the ceiling stays at internal`) — this denial answers `NM-5`.
- Flag a claim the review cannot settle instead of asserting it (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:55-56` `Do not delete the claim, and do not invent authority for it.`).

### Autonomy level

How far does the reviewer act before a human decides?

- Hold `low` autonomy (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:26` `autonomy: low`).
- Report findings, and act on none of them (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:36-37` `it never merges, fixes or re-runs anything itself`).
- Leave the release decision at the human checkpoint (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:78-79` `name the human release-approval checkpoint as the decision's owner`).

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-only at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:167` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace:ro")`), and mounts `/workspace/.memory` read-write so the granted entry write lands (`scripts/run-agent.sh:170` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO/.memory:/workspace/.memory")`). This role reads `/workspace`, writes no file there, and writes one review entry into `/workspace/.memory` (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md:94` `the reviewer edits nothing it reviews`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Role 6 — `project-manager`

What does the bracketing role hold, and what may it never read or write?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the project-manager call?

- Grant `mcp__coursetools__task_tracker` on this role alone (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:71` `Owned exclusively by this role`).
- Grant `mcp__storage__read_entry` and `mcp__storage__list_entries` (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:12-13` `- mcp__storage__list_entries`).
- Deny `mcp__storage__write_entry` (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:80` `the run's results are already recorded by the roles that produced them`) — this denial answers `NM-4`, where a checkpoint record borrowed the reviewer's voice.
- Deny `mcp__storage__update_entry` and `mcp__storage__delete_entry` (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:81-82` `this role revises no record`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_read` (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:74` `the ticket update rests on recorded results`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_write` and `mcp__coursetools__codebase_search` (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:75-76` `the terminal role changes no artifact`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__shell` and `mcp__coursetools__test_runner` (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:77-78` `would overwrite the evidence the status rests on`) — this denial answers `NM-7`.
- Deny `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:79` `performs no corpus lookup`).
- Route the checkpoint record through this role (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:71` `Owned exclusively by this role`; `docs/iteration-log.md:464` `assign checkpoint records to the project-manager`) — this rule answers `NM-4`.

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the project-manager activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` at the run-closing boundary (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:7` `when the user asks for a session summary`).
- Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Return an open question instead of guessing a ticket status (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:61-63` `Guessing a status is not a ticket update.`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may the project-manager touch?

- Hold no retrieval ceiling and no write ceiling (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:81` `"project-manager": "none"`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:80` `already recorded by the roles that produced them`) — this denial answers `NM-5`.
- Read ticket state and stored entries only (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:33-34` `ticket state is the whole of its authority`).

### Autonomy level

How far does the project-manager act before a human decides?

- Hold `low` autonomy (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:24` `autonomy: low`).
- Record the released status rather than deciding it (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:37` `records the released status rather than deciding it`).
- Set no `Done` status without gate evidence (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:53` `Every gate passed`) — this rule answers `NM-7`.

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-only at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:167` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace:ro")`), and mounts no `/workspace/.memory` of its own (`scripts/run-agent.sh:100` `project-manager) ROLE_WS=ro; ROLE_MEM=none; ROLE_TARGET=ro ;;`). This role reads no file in `/workspace`, reads stored entries from `/workspace/.memory`, and writes neither (`.claude/agents/project-manager.md:75-76` `the terminal role changes no artifact`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Role 7 — `researcher`

What does the network role hold, and what may it never read?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the researcher call?

- Grant `mcp__coursetools__web_search` on this role alone (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:61` `The workflow's only network lookup`).
- Grant `mcp__storage__write_entry` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:62` `Writes the research entry at classification`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_read` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:63` `the role holds no repository read`) — a repository claim never comes from the open web.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_write` and `mcp__coursetools__codebase_search` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:64-65` `a repository answer comes from the planner's or the reviewer's own search`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__shell` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:66` `no lookup reaches the network by another path`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__test_runner` and `mcp__coursetools__task_tracker` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:67-68` `gate execution is the tester's role`).
- Deny `mcp__storage__read_entry` and `mcp__storage__list_entries` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:69-70` `the researcher searches no project memory`).
- Deny `mcp__storage__update_entry` and `mcp__storage__delete_entry` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:71-72` `a second lookup is a second entry`).
- Deny `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:73` `the researcher answers external questions only`).

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the researcher activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` inside this role's own context (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:7` `when the user asks for a session summary`).
- Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Return an unresolved point as an open question, never as a finding (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:46-47` `An unresolved point is returned as an open question, never as a finding.`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may the researcher write?

- Hold no retrieval ceiling (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:82` `"researcher": "none"`).
- Write the research entry at `classification: "public"` (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:49` `classification: "public"`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:50` `accepts public and internal writes only`) — this denial answers `NM-5`.
- Attribute every returned source in the entry (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:51-52` `every source the search returned`).

### Autonomy level

How far does the researcher act before a human decides?

- Hold `low` autonomy (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:25` `autonomy: low`).
- Answer the brief's question and decide nothing about the change (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:35` `the researcher returns the answer rather than acting on it`).
- Answer one question per call and return (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:61` `one question per call`).

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-only at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:167` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace:ro")`), and mounts `/workspace/.memory` read-write so the granted entry write lands (`scripts/run-agent.sh:170` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO/.memory:/workspace/.memory")`). This role reads no file in `/workspace`, writes one `public` research entry into `/workspace/.memory`, and reaches the network only through its search tool (`.claude/agents/researcher.md:61` `The workflow's only network lookup`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Role 8 — `beta-tester`

What does the exercising role hold, and what may it never read or repair?

### MCP server and operation access

Which MCP server operations may the beta-tester call?

- Grant all eight `mcp__browser__browser_open`, `mcp__browser__browser_snapshot`, `mcp__browser__browser_click`, `mcp__browser__browser_type`, `mcp__browser__browser_press`, `mcp__browser__browser_diagnostics`, `mcp__browser__browser_screenshot` and `mcp__browser__browser_close` tools (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:10-17` `- mcp__browser__browser_open`) — the exercising role uses the running app instead of reading the repository.
- Grant `mcp__coursetools__file_read` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:18` `- mcp__coursetools__file_read`).
- Grant `mcp__storage__read_entry`, `mcp__storage__list_entries` and `mcp__storage__write_entry` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:19-21` `- mcp__storage__write_entry`).
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__file_write` and `mcp__coursetools__codebase_search` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:23-24` `- mcp__coursetools__file_write`) — it reads the app rather than editing or searching the code under test.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__shell`, `mcp__coursetools__test_runner` and `mcp__coursetools__task_tracker` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:25-27` `- mcp__coursetools__shell`) — no command runs, and ticket state stays with the project manager.
- Deny `mcp__coursetools__web_search` (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:73` `Hold mcp__coursetools__web_search on the Researcher alone`) — one role keeps open-web text out of every coding context.
- Deny `mcp__retrieval__retrieve` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:29` `- mcp__retrieval__retrieve`) — its evidence is the app's behaviour, not the reference corpus.
- Deny `mcp__storage__update_entry` and `mcp__storage__delete_entry` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:30-31` `- mcp__storage__update_entry`) — a result is a new record, and record removal is no role's grant.
- Deny `mcp__gate__run_gate`, `mcp__gate__list_gates`, `mcp__gate__read_audit_log` and `mcp__gate__run_fix` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:32-35` `- mcp__gate__run_gate`) — the check surface stays on the tester.

### Skill activation scope

Which skill may the beta-tester activate, and when?

- Permit `summarize-session` at the end of a session (`.claude/skills/summarize-session/SKILL.md:7` `when the user asks for a session summary`).
- Deny every other skill, because the repository ships three skill files (`find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md` -> `3`).
- Return an observation a snapshot cannot settle as an open question (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:62` `open question, never as a finding`).

### Data classification ceiling

What classification may the beta-tester record?

- Hold no retrieval ceiling (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.json:83` `"beta-tester": "none"`).
- Write the result entry at `classification: "internal"` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:60` `classification: "internal"`).
- Deny `confidential` and `secret` content to the role (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:60` `The storage server accepts`) — this denial answers `NM-5`.
- Report the drained diagnostics in full, with no filtering (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:55` `the drained errors are the evidence`).

### Autonomy level

How far does the beta-tester act before a human decides?

- Hold `low` autonomy (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:36` `autonomy: low`).
- Report findings, and decide nothing about a change (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:45` `decides nothing about a change`).
- Leave the release decision at the human checkpoint (`docs/routing-and-tool-grant-map.md:22` `Low — it reports findings and decides nothing about a change.`).

**Container permissions** — the launcher mounts this repository read-only at `/workspace` for this role (`scripts/run-agent.sh:167` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO:/workspace:ro")`), and mounts `/workspace/.memory` read-write so the entry write and the screenshots land (`scripts/run-agent.sh:170` `MOUNTS+=(-v "$REPO/.memory:/workspace/.memory")`). This role reads `/workspace`, writes no file there, and writes one test-result entry and its screenshots into `/workspace/.memory` (`.claude/agents/beta-tester.md:63` `Never create, edit, move or delete a repository file`). The read-only `.memory/knowledge` and `.memory/reference` layers refuse this role's writes (`docs/memory-architecture.md:160` `denies any write to the read-only layers`).

## Escalation and rollback

What stops a run, and what is reverted when a threshold is missed?

Escalation triggers on a threshold rather than on preference. Three thresholds carry that authority,
and a miss on any one of them stops the run.

- Escalate when the binary gate does not pass (`docs/rubric.md:85` `1. The binary gate G1 passes.`).
- Escalate when the rubric total falls below 17 / 20 (`docs/rubric.md:86` `2. The rubric total is **17 / 20 or higher**.`).
- Escalate when any single dimension scores 1 (`docs/rubric.md:87` `3. No single dimension scores 1.`), because a high total does not outvote one failed dimension.
- Escalate after a role fails twice (`docs/governance-policy.md:65` `Escalate to the human after a role fails twice`), which is the existing review trigger.
- Hand the escalated run to a human, who rules on it rather than the loop retrying (`docs/step-classification.md:180` `Escalation is a judgment about a run, and no rule set settles it.`).

Rollback is one commit and one command, and a threshold decides it in the same way.

- Revert the conversion commit when the script returns a wrong result in the running workflow (`docs/adr/ADR-001-doc-conformance-deterministic-conversion.md:68` `one git revert`).
- Close a rollback decision against the four-run regression rather than a single run (`docs/adr/ADR-001-doc-conformance-deterministic-conversion.md:10` `the integrated end-to-end regression passed on 2026-09-29 across four runs`).
- Record the revert as the next entry's change under gate, where every other change is recorded (`docs/iteration-log.md:14` `- Change under gate: ticket`).

## Eval-gated change control, in the commit history

Where does a change meet the evaluation gate, and how is that visible in the history?

A change reaches `main` through a pull request whose gates have run. The history records the gate's
decision, not the author's intention. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggers on `pull_request` and on a
push to the default branch. It defines nine jobs. One of them is the evaluation harness, and its job
name is `eval-gate`.

The harness does not run unconditionally. It needs the change classifier and the policy suite first.
A guard decides whether it runs at all:
`needs.change-type-check.outputs.requires-governed-check == 'true'`. Whether a change faces the
harness is itself a classified decision.

The practice is recent, and the counts say so. The last twelve first-parent commits on `main` are all
merges, from `#25` to `#37`. Across the whole history the first-parent chain is 191 commits, of which
35 are merges. Earlier work landed directly, so this section claims recent control and no more.

The rule is legible in one commit. `767058f` carries its own verdicts in its message. That message
reads `conformance: pass, 207 findings at base, 207 at HEAD, no rule rose`. It also records `policy,
run in the designed container: 134 passed, 3 failed`, naming the three as environmental. The same
three fail at pristine `origin/main`. `a000bb0` records an exercised control the same way. A call
killed by the per-call wall clock retried once and then settled. A call that exited 7 never retried.

The gating can be inspected rather than assumed. `.memory/gate-audit.log` holds one row per gated
call. Each row carries the calling role, the gate, the exit code and the duration. There are 254
rows, covering 2026-09-28 to 2026-10-04. `scripts/build-audit-trail.py` assembles those rows into the
run's audit trail.

## What did the gate refuse most recently?

Which change did the gate refuse, and what did the refusal say?

On 2026-10-05 the conformance gate refused a change to `docs/orchestration-diagram.md`. The change added a section naming the trigger for each human checkpoint. The gate returned two findings against it before it could land.

The first was R1-NOT-QUESTION. The line after the heading was not the question the section answers. The second was CIT-LITERAL-MISSING. A citation of `docs/governance-policy.md:390` `Escalation and rollback` carried a quoted literal absent from that line.

The author repaired the prose until the same gate returned pass. Only then was the change committed, as `68ec5e4`. The refusal is the point. The gate decided when the change could land, and the history carries the commit that followed it.
