# Session summary — phase A (the proactive summary at the boundary)

Produced in-session by the `summarize-session` skill at the phase-A -> phase-B boundary, **before** the
revised rules were introduced, and confirmed by the operator after a mechanical check that its quoted
artifact text matches the working tree.

Verification performed before confirming (host-side, against `/home/computing/rev`):

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Quoted "What this is" text vs `AGENTS.md` | 1579 chars quoted, 1579 on disk — identical |
| Quoted "Critical rules" text vs `AGENTS.md` | 4434 chars quoted, 4434 on disk — identical |
| R1–R5 copied verbatim from `docs/DOC-STYLE.md` | all five present, character-for-character |
| Open questions carried (no `[UNVERIFIED]` claims dropped) | 6 items, none of them a dropped claim |

## The summary, as produced in the session

### Current Goal

This session applies the documentation standard in `docs/DOC-STYLE.md` to the Komun repository's prose,
section by section, so that every prose claim in the repository's guides carries traceable authority and
conforms to the frozen v1 rule set. Phase A covers `/workspace/AGENTS.md`. Two sections have been
completed — "What this is" and "Critical rules" including its six `###` subsections. No code, migration,
config, test or script file has been modified, and no shell, git, build or test command has been run at
any point in this session; the agent has no `Bash` tool.

### Active Rules and Constraints

The rule set is `docs/DOC-STYLE.md` v1, frozen 2026-09-26. Copied verbatim from `docs/DOC-STYLE.md:17-25`:

```
| Rule | Requirement | How a violation is detected |
| R1 | Every section opens with one purpose sentence. | the first line after the heading starts with "This section" |
| R2 | Every claim carries its authority in parentheses: a `path:line`, or a backticked command with its output. | a claim sentence with no parenthesised authority |
| R3 | A sentence is at most 25 words. | word count of the text between two sentence terminators |
| R4 | A rule is an imperative, and never hedges (`should`, `might`, `probably`, `may want to`). | a bullet whose first word is not a verb |
| R5 | Lists are flat: no nested bullets. | any bullet indented under another bullet |
```

Two operator rulings were in effect and are preserved verbatim in the session:

> Q1: Reading B — every heading opens a section, so all six ### subsections get their own opening
> sentence too, including "Never commit these". Q2: R4 governs bullets that state a rule; "Never log ..."
> counts as an imperative and stays as written; bullets that state facts keep their shape and instead
> gain R2 authority. R4 also governs rules written in prose, so make AGENTS.md:51 verb-initial.

**No rules had been withdrawn or superseded** at the moment this summary was taken — R1–R5 were the
complete current set and `docs/DOC-STYLE.md` was unedited, its version history still recording only v1.

### Decisions Made

1. `docs/DOC-STYLE.md` left unedited — no message stated a rule differing from the file.
2. Section "What this is" rewritten under R1–R5: purpose sentence added, authority attached to every
   claim, the two long sentences split, no bullets so R4/R5 vacuous.
3. Work paused before the second section to resolve the two rule questions; the operator ruled, and the
   rulings were copied into the summary rather than paraphrased.
4. "Critical rules" and all six subsections rewritten under those rulings: seven purpose sentences (one
   per heading), authority on every claim, the 36-word and 37-word sentences split, `AGENTS.md:51` made
   verb-initial, the `**Never log**` bullet kept byte-identical, the five "Never commit these" bullets
   keeping their shape and gaining only citations, no nested bullets introduced.
5. Wording changes flagged rather than decided silently: "AGPL-3.0" -> "AGPL-3.0-or-later"
   (`Cargo.toml:8`), and "builds in ~2 min" -> "finished in 1m51s" (`docs/iteration-log.md:408`).
6. Sections excluded by the operator and deliberately untouched: "Code layout" and
   "Key architecture facts".

### Current State of the Artifacts

`AGENTS.md` sections "What this is" and "Critical rules" — full current text, quoted in the session and
verified byte-identical to the working tree (see the table above). `docs/DOC-STYLE.md` unmodified.

### Open Questions

1. No `Claims needing verification` lists exist: every claim in both sections was settled by a line read
   or a search run in the session, so nothing was marked `[UNVERIFIED]`.
2. "SvelteKit 5": `web/package.json:13` is `"@sveltejs/kit": "^2.0.0"` and `:20` is `"svelte": "^5.0.0"`,
   so the "5" is Svelte's version, not SvelteKit's. Changing the term would change an assertion, so it
   was left as the document had it.
3. "AGPL-3.0" rendered as "AGPL-3.0-or-later" — operator's call if the short form is preferred.
4. "verified" retained for the docker build claim, whose authority is a run recorded in an earlier
   session (`docs/iteration-log.md:408-409`) and which this agent cannot re-run (no `Bash`).
5. Remaining R2/R3 violations in the untouched sections of `AGENTS.md` ("Code layout",
   "Key architecture facts").
6. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` is in the run's scope but not started, and no boundary had been supplied for it.

### Next Planned Action

Supply a phase boundary naming the next artifact and stating whether R1–R5 plus the Q1/Q2 rulings carry
over unchanged, then apply the standard to that one named section.

## Confirmation

The operator confirmed the summary as accurate and supplied boundary 1 in the next message. The summary
was confirmed before the revised rules were introduced, which is what keeps the phase-A state in it
uncontaminated by the change that follows — the point of taking it at this boundary rather than later.
