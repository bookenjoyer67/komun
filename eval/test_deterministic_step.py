"""Unit tests for scripts/validate_doc_conformance_deterministic.py.

Lesson 4.3, "Implement the Deterministic Replacement", block [74] (VERBATIM):

    Create eval/test_deterministic_step.py. The tests must include:
    - At least three inputs drawn from the holdout set you used to assess stability
    - At least one edge case the agent handled that the script must also handle
    - At least one input that exercises the limitation you just described in the step above

The holdout set is the step's own recorded work: the three calibration cycles whose artifacts the
converted step was measured on -- the documentation-standard run (`docs/iteration-log.md:640`
`Run 001 (workflow 4`), the three citation re-execution cycles (`docs/iteration-log.md:784` `Run 003
(workflow 3`), and the log whose own pointers were repaired by hand (`docs/iteration-log.md:359`
`Every pointer that drifted was repaired`). The tests run the real files, so a rule that stops
finding real violations is visible as a failure.

Run with:  pytest eval/test_deterministic_step.py -v
